# FetiiAI Hackathon Submission

## 🎯 What I Built

I created **FetiiAI**, an interactive GPT-powered chatbot that transforms Fetii's rideshare data into intelligent insights through natural language queries. The chatbot can answer complex questions about trip patterns, demographic trends, and group movement data in Austin, TX.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Interactive GPT-Powered Chatbot
- Natural language query processing
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration for intelligent responses
- Context-aware data analysis and insights

### ✅ Smart Data Analysis
- **2,000 trips** analyzed with comprehensive processing
- **11,903 rider records** with detailed trip information  
- **7,276 users** with demographic data
- Automatic location categorization and pattern recognition

### ✅ Real-World Query Capabilities
Successfully answers the hackathon's example queries:
- ✅ "How many groups went to Moody Center last month?" → **6 trips found**
- ✅ "What are the top drop-off spots for 18-24 year-olds on Saturday nights?" → **Downtown (834), Other (1141), Campus (201)**
- ✅ "When do large groups (6+ riders) typically ride downtown?" → **Peak at 22:00 (157 trips), 23:00 (140 trips)**

### ✅ Interactive Visualizations
- Dynamic charts and graphs using Plotly
- Real-time data filtering and aggregation
- Mobile-responsive design

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. **Data Processing Engine** (`data_processor.py`)
- Loads and cleans Fetii's Excel data
- Categorizes locations (Campus, Downtown, Entertainment, etc.)
- Extracts temporal patterns (hour, day, week, month)
- Creates demographic and group size analysis

### 2. **Query Analysis System**
- Natural language processing to understand user intent
- Pattern matching for locations, time periods, demographics
- Smart parameter extraction from conversational queries

### 3. **GPT Integration** (`fetii_chatbot.py`)
- OpenAI API integration for natural language responses
- Context-aware data analysis
- Conversational interface with detailed insights

### 4. **Demo Version** (`fetii_chatbot_demo.py`)
- Works without API keys for easy testing
- Same functionality with rule-based responses
- Perfect for immediate demonstration

### 5. **Streamlit Interface**
- Interactive web application
- Real-time query processing
- Sidebar with example queries and data summary
- Mobile-responsive design

## 📊 Technical Architecture

```
User Query → Query Analysis → Data Processing → GPT Response → Visualization

Natural Language → Pattern Match → Pandas/NumPy → OpenAI API → Plotly Charts
```

## 🎨 Demo Access

### **Live Demo**: 
Run `streamlit run fetii_chatbot_demo.py` for immediate access

### **Full Version**: 
Run `streamlit run fetii_chatbot.py` with OpenAI API key

### **Test Suite**: 
Run `python test_queries.py` to validate all functionality

## 📈 Key Insights Discovered

- **Age Distribution**: 18-24 year olds dominate (9,052 riders, 75% of demographic data)
- **Group Dynamics**: Very large groups (8+ passengers) are most common (10,218 records)
- **Location Patterns**: Campus/University (655 pickups) and Downtown (551 dropoffs) are top destinations
- **Temporal Trends**: Evening hours (22:00-23:00) show peak activity for large groups
- **Data Coverage**: 9-day period (Aug 31 - Sep 8, 2025) with comprehensive trip data

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

- ✅ **No Setup Required**: Demo version works immediately
- ✅ **Cloud Deployable**: Ready for Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or Docker
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with new data sources

## 🔮 What I'd Improve Next

### **Enhanced AI Capabilities**
- Fine-tuned language model specifically for rideshare data
- Multi-turn conversation memory
- Predictive analytics for demand forecasting

### **Real-Time Features**
- Live data integration with Fetii's API
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Push notifications for interesting patterns

### **Advanced Analytics**
- Machine learning models for trip prediction
- Route optimization insights
- Dynamic pricing recommendations

### **User Experience**
- Voice interface for hands-free querying
- Mobile app with native features
- Advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities
